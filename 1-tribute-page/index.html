        <h2>Greek Poet of Odes</h2>
        <p>Pindar was an Ancient Greek lyric poet from Thebes. Of the canonical nine lyric poets of ancient Greece, his work is the best preserved. Quintilian wrote, "Of the nine lyric poets, Pindar is by far the greatest, in virtue of his inspired magnificence, the beauty of his thoughts and figures, the rich exuberance of his language and matter, and his rolling flood of eloquence, characteristics which, as Horace rightly held, make him inimitable." His poems can also, however, seem difficult and even peculiar. The Athenian comic playwright Eupolis once remarked that they "are already reduced to silence by the disinclination of the multitude for elegant learning". Some scholars in the modern age also found his poetry perplexing, at least until the 1896 discovery of some poems by his rival Bacchylides; comparisons of their work showed that many of Pindar's idiosyncrasies are typical of archaic genres rather than of only the poet himself. His poetry, while admired by critics, still challenges the casual reader and his work is largely unread among the general public.</p>
        <p>Scholars at the Library of Alexandria had collected his compositions in seventeen books, organized according to genre:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 book of <i>hymnoi</i> "hymns"</li>
          <li>1 book of <i>paianes</i> "paeans"</li>
          <li>2 books of <i>dithuramboi</i> "dithyrambs"</li>
          <li>2 books of <i>prosodia</i> "processionals"</li>
          <li>3 books of <i>parthenia</i> "songs for maidens"</li>
          <li>2 books of <i>huporchemata</i> "songs for light dances"</li>
          <li>1 book of <i>enkomia</i> "songs of praise"</li>
          <li>1 book of <i>threnoi</i> "laments"</li>
          <li>4 books of <i>epinikia</i> "victory odes"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of this vast and varied corpus, only the <i>epinikia</i> odes written to commemorate athletic victories survive in complete form; the rest survive only by quotations in other ancient authors or from papyrus scraps unearthed in Egypt.</p>
