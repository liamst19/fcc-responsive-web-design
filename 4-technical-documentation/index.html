          <p>These commands move the cursor position.  If the new position is off of the screen, the screen is scrolled to show the cursor (see also 'scrolljump' and 'scrolloff' options).</p>
          <h3>General remarks</h3>
          <p>If you want to know where you are in the file use the "CTRL-G" command CTRL-G or the "g CTRL-G" command g_CTRL-G. If you set the 'ruler' option, the cursor position is continuously shown in the status line (which slows down Vim a little).</p>
          <p>Experienced users prefer the hjkl keys because they are always right under their fingers. Beginners often prefer the arrow keys, because they do not know what the hjkl keys do. The mnemonic value of hjkl is clear from looking at the keyboard.  Think of j as an arrow pointing downwards.</p>
          <p>The 'virtualedit' option can be set to make it possible to move the cursor to positions where there is no character or halfway a character.</p>

        <header><h2>Motions and operators</h2></header>
        <article>
          <p>The motion commands can be used after an operator command, to have the command operate on the text that was moved over.  That is the text between the cursor position before and after the motion.  Operators are generally used to delete or change text.  The following operators are available:</p>
          <dl class="commands">
            <dt>c</dt>
            <dd>change</dd>
            <dt>d</dt>
            <dd>delete</dd>
            <dt>y</dt>
            <dd>yank into register (does not change the text)</dd>
            <dt>~</dt>
            <dd>swap case (only if 'tildeop' is set)</dd>
            <dt>g~</dt>
            <dd>swap case</dd>
            <dt>gu</dt>
            <dd>make lowercase</dd>
            <dt>gU</dt>
            <dd>make uppercase</dd>
            <dt>!</dt>
            <dd>filter through an external program</dd>
            <dt>=</dt>
            <dd>filter through 'equalprg' or C-indenting if empty</dd>
            <dt>gq</dt>
            <dd>text formatting</dd>
            <dt>gw</dt>
            <dd>text formatting with no cursor movement</dd>
            <dt>g?</dt>
            <dd>ROT13 encoding</dd>
            <dt>&gt;</dt>
            <dd>shift right</dd>
            <dt>&lt;</dt>
            <dd>shift left</dd>
            <dt>zf</dt>
            <dd>define a fold</dd>
            <dt>g@</dt>
            <dd>call function set with the 'operatorfunc' option</dd>
          </dl>
          <p>If the motion includes a count and the operator also had a count before it, the two counts are multiplied.  For example: "2d3w" deletes six words.</p>
          <p>After applying the operator the cursor is mostly left at the start of the text that was operated upon.  For example, "yfe" doesn't move the cursor, but "yFe" moves the cursor leftwards to the "e" where the yank started.</p>
          <p>The operator either affects whole lines, or the characters between the start and end position.  Generally, motions that move between lines affect lines (are linewise), and motions that move within a line affect characters (are characterwise).  However, there are some exceptions.</p>
          <p>A character motion is either inclusive or exclusive.  When inclusive, the start and end position of the motion are included in the operation.  When exclusive, the last character towards the end of the buffer is not included.  Linewise motions always include the start and end position.</p>
          <p>Which motions are linewise, inclusive or exclusive is mentioned with the command.  There are however, two general exceptions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>If the motion is exclusive and the end of the motion is in column 1, the end of the motion is moved to the end of the previous line and the motion becomes inclusive.  Example: "}" moves to the first line after a paragraph, but "d}" will not include that line.</li>
            <li>If the motion is exclusive, the end of the motion is in column 1 and the start of the motion was at or before the first non-blank in the line, the motion becomes linewise.  Example: If a paragraph begins with some blanks and you do "d}" while standing on the first non-blank, all the lines of the paragraph are deleted, including the blanks.  If you do a put now, the deleted lines will be inserted below the cursor position.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Note that when the operator is pending (the operator command is typed, but the motion isn't yet), a special set of mappings can be used.  See :omap.</p>
          <p>Instead of first giving the operator and then a motion you can use Visual mode: mark the start of the text with "v", move the cursor to the end of the text that is to be affected and then hit the operator.  The text between the start and the cursor position is highlighted, so you can see what text will be operated upon.  This allows much more freedom, but requires more key strokes and has limited redo functionality.  See the chapter on Visual mode Visual-mode.</p>
          <p>You can use a ":" command for a motion.  For example "d:call FindEnd()".  But this can't be repeated with "." if the command is more than one line.  This can be repeated:<br/>
          <code>d:call search("f")&lt;CR&gt;</code><br/>
          This cannot be repeated:<br/>
          <code>d:if 1&lt;CR&gt;<br/>
&emsp;call search("f")&lt;CR&gt;<br/>
endif&lt;CR&gt;</code><br/>
          Note that when using ":" any motion becomes characterwise exclusive.
</p>
<h3>Forcing a motion to be linewise, characterwise or blockwise</h3>
          <p>When a motion is not of the type you would like to use, you can force another type by using "v", "V" or CTRL-V just after the operator.</p>
          <p>Example:<br/>
          <code>dj</code><br/>
          deletes two lines<br/>
          <code>dvj</code><br/>
          deletes from the cursor position until the character below the cursor<br/>
          <code>d&lt;C-V&gt;j</code><br/>
          deletes the character under the cursor and the character below the cursor.</p>
          <p>Be careful with forcing a linewise movement to be used characterwise or blockwise, the column may not always be defined.</p>
          <dl class="commands">
            <dt>v</dt>
            <dd><p>When used after an operator, before the motion command: Force the operator to work characterwise, also when the motion is linewise. If the motion was linewise, it will become exclusive.</p>
              <p>If the motion already was characterwise, toggle inclusive/exclusive.  This can be used to make an exclusive motion inclusive and an inclusive motion exclusive.</p></dd>
            <dt>V</dt>
            <dd>When used after an operator, before the motion command: Force the operator to work linewise, also when the motion is characterwise.</dd>
            <dt>CTRL-V</dt>
            <dd>When used after an operator, before the motion command: Force the operator to work blockwise. This works like Visual block mode selection, with the corners defined by the cursor position before and after the motion.</dd>

          <p>A sequence of folded lines is counted for one word of a single character.  "w" and "W", "e" and "E" move to the start/end of the first word or WORD after a range of folded lines.  "b" and "B" move to the start of the first word or WORD before the fold.</p>
          <p>Special case: "cw" and "cW" are treated like "ce" and "cE" if the cursor is on a non-blank.  This is because "cw" is interpreted as change-word, and a word does not include the following white space.</p>
          <p>Another special case: When using the "w" motion in combination with an operator and the last word moved over is at the end of a line, the end of that word becomes the end of the operated text, not the first word in the next line.</p>
          <p>The original Vi implementation of "e" is buggy.  For example, the "e" command will stop on the first character of a line if the previous line was empty.  But when you use "2e" this does not happen.  In Vim "ee" and "2e" are the same, which is more logical.  However, this causes a small incompatibility between Vi and Vim.</p>

          <p>These commands move over three kinds of text objects.</p>
          <p>A sentence is defined as ending at a '.', '!' or '?' followed by either the end of a line, or by a space or tab.  Any number of closing ')', ']', '"' and ''' characters may appear after the '.', '!' or '?' before the spaces, tabs or end of line.  A paragraph and section boundary is also a sentence boundary.  If the 'J' flag is present in 'cpoptions', at least two spaces have to follow the punctuation mark; &lt;Tab&gt;s are not recognized as white space.  The definition of a sentence cannot be changed.</p>
          <p>A paragraph begins after each empty line, and also at each of a set of paragraph macros, specified by the pairs of characters in the 'paragraphs' option.  The default is "IPLPPPQPP TPHPLIPpLpItpplpipbp", which corresponds to the macros ".IP", ".LP", etc.  (These are nroff macros, so the dot must be in the first column).  A section boundary is also a paragraph boundary.  Note that a blank line (only containing white space) is NOT a paragraph boundary.  Also note that this does not include a '{' or '}' in the first column.  When the '{' flag is in 'cpoptions' then '{' in the first column is used as a paragraph boundary posix.</p>
          <p>A section begins after a form-feed (&lt;C-L&gt;) in the first column and at each of a set of section macros, specified by the pairs of characters in the 'sections' option.  The default is "SHNHH HUnhsh", which defines a section to start at the nroff macros ".SH", ".NH", ".H", ".HU", ".nh" and ".sh".</p>
          <p>The "]" and "[" commands stop at the '{' or '}' in the first column.  This is useful to find the start or end of a function in a C program.  Note that the first character of the command determines the search direction and the second character the typeof brace found.</p>
          <p>If your '{' or '}' are not in the first column, and you would like to use "[[" and "]]" anyway, trythese mappings:<br/>
            <p><code>:map [[ ?{&lt;CR&gt;w99[{<br/>
            :map ][ /}&lt;CR&gt;b99]}<br/>
            :map ]] j0[[%/{&lt;CR&gt;<br/>

          <p>This is a series of commands that can only be used while in Visual mode or after an operator.  The commands that start with "a" select "a"n object including white space, the commands starting with "i" select an "inner" object without white space, or just the white space.  Thus the "inner" commands always select less text than the "a" commands.</p>
          <p>These commands are not available when the +textobjects feature has been disabled at compile time.  Also see gn and gN, operating on the last search pattern.</p>

          <p>Note the difference between using a movement command and an object.  The movement command operates from here (cursor position) to where the movement takes us.  When using an object the whole object is operated upon, no matter where on the object the cursor is.  For example, compare "dw" and "daw": "dw" deletes from the cursor position to the start of the next word, "daw" deletes the word under the cursor and the space after or before it.</p>

          <h3>Tag blocks</h3>

          <p>For the "it" and "at" text objects an attempt is done to select blocks between matching tags for HTML and XML.  But since these are not completely compatible there are a few restrictions.</p>
          <p>The normal method is to select a &lt;tag&gt; until the matching &lt;/tag&gt;.  For "at" the tags are included, for "it" they are excluded.  But when "it" is repeated the tags will be included (otherwise nothing would change).  Also, "it" used on a tag block with nocontents will select the leading tag.</p>
          <p>"&lt;aaa/&gt;" items are skipped.  Case is ignored, also for XML where case does matter.</p>
          <p>In HTML it is possible to have a tag like &lt;br&gt; or &lt;meta ...&gt; without a matching end tag.  These are ignored.</p>
          <p>The text objects are tolerant about mistakes.  Stray end tags are ignored.</p>

          <p>A mark is not visible in any way.  It is just a position in the file that is remembered.  Do not confuse marks with named registers, they are totally unrelated.</p>

          <dl class="commands">

          <p>Lowercase marks 'a to 'z are remembered as long as the file remains in the buffer list.  If you remove the file from the buffer list, all its marks are lost.  If you delete a line that contains a mark, that mark is erased.</p>
          <p>Lowercase marks can be used in combination with operators.  For example: "d't" deletes the lines from the cursor position to mark 't'.  Hint: Use mark 't' for Top, 'b' for Bottom, etc..  Lowercase marks are restored when using undo and redo.</p>
          <p>Uppercase marks 'A to 'Z include the file name.  You can use them to jump from file to file.  You can only use an uppercase mark with an operator if the mark is in the current file.  The line number of the mark remains correct, even if you insert/delete lines or edit another file for a moment.  When the 'viminfo' option is not empty, uppercase marks are kept in the .viminfo file.  See viminfo-file-marks.</p>
          <p>Numbered marks '0 to '9 are quite different.  They can not be set directly.  They are only present when using a viminfo file viminfo-file.  Basically '0 is the location of the cursor when you last exited Vim, '1 the last but one time, etc.  Use the "r" flag in 'viminfo' to specify files for which no Numbered mark should be stored.  See viminfo-file-marks.</p>

          <p>After executing an operator the Cursor is put at the beginning of the text that was operated upon.  After a put command ("p" or "P") the cursor is sometimes placed at the first inserted line and sometimes on the last inserted character.  The four commands above put the cursor at either end.  Example: After yanking 10 lines you want to go to the last one of them: "10Y']".  After inserting several lines with the "p" command you want to jump to the lowest inserted line: "p']".  This also works for text that has been inserted.</p>

        <header><h2>Jumps</h2></header>
        <article>

          <p>A "jump" is a command that normally moves the cursor several lines away.  If you make the cursor "jump" the position of the cursor before the jump is remembered.  You can return to that position with the "''" and "``" commands, unless the line containing that position was changed or deleted.  The following commands are "jump" commands: "'", "`", "G", "/", "?", "n", "N", "%", "(", ")", "[[", "]]", "{", "}", ":s", ":tag", "L", "M", "H" and the commands that start editing a new file.</p>

          <dl class="commands">

            <dd>Print the jump list (not a motion command).<br/>

            <dt>:cle[arjumps]</dt>
            <dd>Clear the jump list of the current window.<br/>
              {not available without the |+jumplist| feature}</dd>
            </dl>

          <p>Jumps are remembered in a jump list.  With the CTRL-O and CTRL-I command you can go to cursor positions before older jumps, and back again.  Thus you can move up and down the list.  There is a separate jump list for each window.  The maximum number of entries is fixed at 100.  {not available without the |+jumplist| feature}</p>

          <p>For example, after three jump commands you have this jump list:</p>

<p><pre><code>jump  line  col file/text
   3     1    0 some text
   2    70    0 another line
   1  1154   23 end.
&gt;</code></pre></p>

          <p>The "file/text" column shows the file name, or the text at the jump if it is in the current file (an indent is removed and a long line is truncated to fit in the window).</p>

          <p>You are currently in line 1167.  If you then use the CTRL-O command, the cursor is put in line 1154.  This results in:</p>

<p><pre><code>jump  line  col file/text
   2     1    0 some text
   1    70    0 another line
 &gt; 0  1154   23 end.
   1  1167    0 foo bar</code></pre></p>

<p>The pointer will be set at the last used jump position.  The next CTRL-O command will use the entry above it, the next CTRL-I command will use the entry below it.  If the pointer is below the last entry, this indicates that you did not use a CTRL-I or CTRL-O before.  In this case the CTRL-O command will cause the cursor position to be added to the jump list, so you can get back to the position before the CTRL-O.  In this case this is line 1167.</p>

<p>With more CTRL-O commands you will go to lines 70 and 1.  If you use CTRL-I you can go back to 1154 and 1167 again.  Note that the number in the "jump" column indicates the count for the CTRL-O or CTRL-I command that takes you to this position.</p>

<p>If you use a jump command, the current line number is inserted at the end of the jump list.  If the same line was already in the jump list, it is removed.  The result is that when repeating CTRL-O you will get back to old positions only once.</p>

<p>When the :keepjumps command modifier is used, jumps are not stored in the jumplist.  Jumps are also not stored in other cases, e.g., in a :global command.  You can explicitly add a jump by setting the ' mark with "m'".  Note that calling setpos() does not do this.</p>

<p>After the CTRL-O command that got you into line 1154 you could give another jump command (e.g., "G").  The jump list would then become:</p>

<p><pre><code>jump  line  col file/text
   4     1    0 some text
   3    70    0 another line
   2  1167    0 foo bar
   1  1154   23 end.
 &gt;</code></pre></p>

<p>The line numbers will be adjusted for deleted and inserted lines.  This fails if you stop editing a file without writing, like with ":n!".</p>

<p>When you split a window, the jumplist will be copied to the new window.</p>

<p>If you have included the ' item in the 'viminfo' option the jumplist will be stored in the viminfo file and restored when starting Vim.</p>


          <h3>CHANGE LIST JUMPS</h3>

          <p>When making a change the cursor position is remembered.  One position is remembered for every change that can be undone, unless it is close to a previous change.  Two commands can be used to jump to positions of changes, also those that have been undone:</p>

          <dl class="commands">
            <dt>g;</dt>
            <dd>Go to [count] older position in change list.  If [count] is larger than the number of older change positions go to the oldest change.<br/>
              If there is no older change an error message is given.<br/>
              (not a motion command)<br/>
              {not available without the |+jumplist| feature}</dd>

            <dt>g,</dt>
            <dd>Go to [count] newer cursor position in change list.  Just like g; but in the opposite direction.<br/>
              (not a motion command)<br/>
              {not available without the |+jumplist| feature}</dd>
          </dl>

          <p>When using a count you jump as far back or forward as possible.  Thus you can use "999g;" to go to the first change for which the position is still remembered.  The number of entries in the change list is fixed and is the same as for the jumplist.</p>

          <p>When two undo-able changes are in the same line and at a column position less than 'textwidth' apart only the last one is remembered.  This avoids that a sequence of small changes in a line, for example "xxxxx", adds many positions to the change list.  When 'textwidth' is zero 'wrapmargin' is used.  When that also isn't set a fixed number of 79 is used.  Detail: For the computations bytes are used, not characters, to avoid a speed penalty (this only matters for multi-byte encodings).</p>

          <p>Note that when text has been inserted or deleted the cursor position might be a bit different from the position of the change.  Especially when lines have been deleted.</p>

          <p>When the :keepjumps command modifier is used the position of a change is not remembered.</p>

          <dl class="commands">
          <dt>:changes</dt>
          <dd>Print the change list.  A "&gt;" character indicates the current position.  Just after a change it is below the newest entry, indicating that g; takes you to the newest entry position.  The first column indicates the count needed to take you to this position.  Example:
<pre><code>change line  col text
    3     9    8 bla bla bla
    2    11   57 foo is a bar
    1    14   54 the latest changed line
  &gt;
</code></pre>
            The 3g; command takes you to line 9.  Then the
            output of :changes is:
<pre><code>change line  col text
  &gt; 0     9    8 bla bla bla
    1    11   57 foo is a bar
    2    14   54 the latest changed line
</code></pre>
            Now you can use "g," to go to line 11 and "2g," to go to line 14.</dd>

          When 'cpoptions' contains "M" cpo-M backslashes before parens and braces are ignored.  Without "M" the number of backslashes matters: an even number doesn't match with an odd number.  Thus in "( \) )" and "\( ( \)" the first and last parenthesis match.<br/>

'(', '{', '[', ']', '}' and ')' are also ignored (parens and braces inside single quotes).  Note that this works fine for C, but not for Perl, where singlequotes are used for strings.<br/>
<br/>
          Nothing special is done for matches in comments.  You can either use the matchit plugin matchit-install or put quotes aroundmatches.<br/>
<br/>
          No count is allowed, {count}% jumps to a line {count} percentage down the file N%.  Using '%' on #if/#else/#endif makes the movement linewise.</dd>

          <p>The above four commands can be used to go to the start or end of the current code block.  It is like doing "%" on the '(', ')', '{' or '}' at the other end of the code block, but you can do this from anywhere in the code block.  Very useful for C programs.  Example: When standing on "case x:", "[{" will bring you back to the switch statement.</p>

          <p>The above two commands assume that the file contains a class with methods.  The class definition is surrounded in '{' and '}'.  Each method in the class is also surrounded with '{' and '}'.  This applies to the Java language.  The file looks like this:</p>

<p><pre><code>// comment
class foo {
  int method_one() {
    body_one();
  }
  int method_two() {
    body_two();
  }
}</code></pre></p>

          <p>Starting with the cursor on "body_two()", using "[m" will jump to the '{' at the start of "method_two()" (obviously this is much more useful when the method is long!).  Using "2[m" will jump to the start of "method_one()".  Using "3[m" will jump to the start of the class.</p>

            <dd>go to [count] next unmatched "#else" or "#endif".  exclusive motion.</dd>
          </dl>

          <p>These two commands work in C programs that contain #if/#else/#endif constructs.  It brings you to the start or end of the #if/#else/#endif where the current line is included.  You can then use "%" to go to the matching line.</p>
